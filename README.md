Marcus Little's User Manual - Communicating with me

**What are your primary goals as a human being?**

- To never stop learning!
- To leave a lasting impact through my interactions with others.
- To provide for my family ❤️

**What do you want us to know about your communication style?**

- I try to be as concise as possible in both written and verbal communication; I prefer only to say as much as needed to get the point across.

**What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?**

- I’m happy to answer (or find the answer) to any question, but I’m typically hesitant to volunteer information unless I’m certain it’s accurate.
- My style is largely to “take a stab at doing the thing” first and ask questions later. I will always reach out if the action I’m going to take has potential consequences, but this is all to say: PLEASE stop me if you see me doing something that can be done differently (or better)! Otherwise, I tend to just keep chugging along 🚂

**How can you best work with me?**

- I love to learn by doing; I also believe that digging into issues, getting stuck, and teaching others what you’ve learned is the best way to solidify concepts. Let’s pair!

**What are your pet peeves?**

- Making decisions based on assumptions.
- Self-limiting thinking.

**What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?**

- Sometimes I get too comfortable in the rhythm and grind of day to day work and don’t take enough time out to see the bigger picture.
